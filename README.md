# JS-Corner
JS-Corner is a Javascript blog related to coding challenges and solutions. Here is where I post every JavaScript code challenge I manage to solve and how I did it. 
It is very useful for any Junior Developer or Senior who needs to brush up some code challenges.

## Features
- fully responsive built with EJS and CSS
- Easy scalability thanks to the use of templating with EJS
- Interaction with an online Database (Mongo Atlas)

## Deployment (how to get the project running?)
Fork it on your github account, and clone it locally.
From your Command Line Interface, ``cd`` into the folder and run the first package.json script: ``npm start`` . It will launch the app and bundle up the code.
Once budled up, it will serve the file on port 3000. Run it from the browser, and the site will be there.
